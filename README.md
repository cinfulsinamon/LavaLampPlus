# Lava Lamp+ Shader
# [Download the Unity package here](https://github.com/cinfulsinamon/LavaLamp/releases/latest)
A raymarched lava lamp shader intended for use on VRChat avatars. Should work in any Unity project using the Built-in Render Pipeline.
This version has been edited to use ThryEditor for the UI and adds the following features:
- UV map selection (slots 1-4)
- Color Adjust for the glass and lava (both all at once and per subsection)
- A decal slot
- Separate roughness & reflection map support (one image, multiple channels)
- Minimum reflectiveness (old reflectiveness slider acts as the max)
- masks for tint, color adjust, and decals (can be different channels on one image)
  
This is my first time editing a shader so please kindly let me know what things are wrong or broken!
Settings should transfer over if you change from the original shader.

Be sure to read the instructions :>
